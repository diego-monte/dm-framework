# DM-FRAMEWORK

The framework has the objective of easy web development, integrating the back-end to the front-end with ease.

# Install
* Deploy the dm-framework.
* Give permission with the command <b>chmod -R 777</b> in <b>/dm-framework</b>.
* You will need to create an example database "<b>dm_framework</b>".
* You will have to fill in the fields with your bank details.
* After installation, if everything is fine, remove the <b>install.php</b> installation file.

# ScreenShots
Fill in correctly with the connection data and the bank created.

If there was no error in the checklists that means everything went well, don't forget to remove the install.php installation file
